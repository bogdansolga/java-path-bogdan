Write a program which uses a City class to showcase the usage of the main collection types - List, Set and Map.
The following collection types will be used:
    - for lists: ArrayList and LinkedList
    - for sets: HashSet and TreeSet
    - for maps: HashMap and TreeMap

Featured operations:
	- adding cities to the collection
	- displaying the added cities
	- removing a city by index or key

The City class has the following properties:
	- country
	- name
	- tourismIndex
	- beautyIndex

Two cities are considered equal if they have the same country, name and beautyIndex.
The cars sorting will be done based on their country, name and tourismIndex.

When iterating over the cars collection, display them using the internal 'toString' method.


Please do not copy & paste code from any previous test; write the classes and the methods from scratch.

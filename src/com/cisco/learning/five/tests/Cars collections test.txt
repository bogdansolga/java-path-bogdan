Write a program which uses a Car class to showcase the usage of the main collection types - List, Set and Map.
The following collection types will be used:
    - for lists: ArrayList and LinkedList
    - for sets: HashSet and TreeSet
    - for maps: HashMap and TreeMap

Featured operations:
	- adding cars to the collection
	- displaying the added cars
	- removing a car by index or key

The Car class has the following properties:
	- producer
	- model
	- vin (Vehicle Identification Number)
	- rating

Two cars are considered equal if they have the same producer, model and rating. 
The cars sorting will be done based on their producer, model and rating.

When iterating over the cars collection, display them using the internal 'toString' method.


Please do not copy & paste code from any previous test; write the classes and the methods from scratch.

Write a program which uses a Monkey class to showcase the usage of the main collection types - List, Set and Map.
The following collection types will be used:
    - for lists: ArrayList and LinkedList
    - for sets: HashSet and TreeSet
    - for maps: HashMap and TreeMap

Featured operations:
	- adding monkeys to the collection
	- displaying the added monkeys
	- removing a monkey by index or key

The Monkey class has the following properties:
	- race
	- name
	- age
	- ugliness

Two monkeys are considered equal if they have the same race, name and age.
The monkeys sorting will be done based on their race, age and ugliness.

When iterating over the monkeys collection, display them using the internal 'toString' method.


Please do not copy & paste code from any previous test; write the classes and the methods from scratch.
